Tracktr is an open-source NextJS application that allows you to keep track of movies and tv shows. It is hosted on [https://tracktr.app/](https://tracktr.app/) and you can make a free account right now.

Here we are again, a bit late and a bit of a small changelog.

We fixed:

- Overview of movies & shows a person starred in sorting incorrect [#393](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/393)
- Watching episodes at the same time breaking up next [#391](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/391)
- Performance improvements for up next/progress page
- Meta tags (again)

We added:

- Watchlist button to movies & series posters [#390](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/390)
- A share button [#329](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/329)
- Automatically switch to list view on mobile release calandar [#346](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/346)
- Progress page [#358](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/358)
- Editing, removing, liking and sharing reviews [#355](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/355)
- Exporting your watch history [#400](https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/pull/400)

So the big features are the progress page, a complete overhaul of the reviews (yay editing!) and exporting all of your watch history to a CSV (without the need to pay us money).

Have a great April, we've been busy but there have been some performance improvements!
