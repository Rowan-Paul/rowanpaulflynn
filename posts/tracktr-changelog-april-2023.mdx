Tracktr is an open-source NextJS application that allows you to keep track of movies and tv shows. It is hosted on [https://tracktr.app/](https://tracktr.app/) and you can make a free account right now.

We've been busy, so there haven't been that many things done on Tracktr. The main thing we've done is updating up next to no longer need calls to TMDB but only our own database so it's now around 1/3 faster than before! We also added Vercel analytics, this is completely anonymous way to get some stats on how many sessions we get (#412)[https://github.com/Tracktr/tracktr-client/issues/412].

Hopefully May will bring some more features, but we'll see you then.
